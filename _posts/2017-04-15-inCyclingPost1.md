*Αυτό ειναι το πρώτο μου ποστ*


## Να έχεις πλάνο στη ζωή σου

So you have built a nice hiring pipeline: the job description is on point, recruiters are out there bringing in relevant, filtered CVs, you have the questions and 
checks to get a good assessment of incoming candidates. 


### Να παλεύεις κάθε μέρα για την επιτυχία (και να χρησιμοποιείς το https://stackedit.io/editor για να γράφεις)

To be honest, I should not even be mentioning this, as it feels a little bit like stating the benefits of breathing. 

But don't just walk into an interview without some notes on your notebook (or at least on the margins of the CV).
This means that you have actually spent some time going through the CV, at your own pace and preparing a set of topics 
you want to focus on.  

### ...and Man created Git!

To keep track of candidates you could go for a dedicated piece of software or some expensive SaaS HR solution.
 
Think about it:

* Each new candidate is a pull request (PR).
The PR contains the candidate's CV and possibly code submission.
* All team members (or even interviewers from other teams) are added as reviewers
* You keep track of the progress with PR comments
* Eventually the candidate either accepts the offer (merge) or declines (reject).

This way everyone keeps track of things and, as an added bonus, you have an easy-to-access repo of all candidate and team 
member CVs.  

We then create a branch `jane-superdoe` to modify the repo as follows and create as PR on the back of that.

Team member 1

> * Why is he changing jobs every 1.5y on average?
> * He managed to become tech. lead 4y after graduation. Why change?
> * Looked him up and his GitHub account shows no activity (https://github.com/foo_bar)


#### Assignment review

In a similar fashion, if there is a code or assignment review involved, you can also keep notes in the PR.

These will feed back to the next step (e.g. face-to-face discussion of the assignment)


Happy hiring!
